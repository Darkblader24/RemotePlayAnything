## Installation
- Download the latest .exe file from [here](https://github.com/Darkblader24/RemotePlayAnything/releases)
- Download a donor game from Steam that has Remote Play Together enabled
  - A very good donor game is [ANYKEY](https://store.steampowered.com/app/790450/ANYKEY/)
  - It's free, small (40mb) and no longer gets updates, so it's perfect
- Go into the directory in which your donor game is installed and find its launch binary
- Rename this executable to anything else
- Paste the downloaded file "RemotePlayAnything.exe" into the same folder as the binary (.exe file) of your donor game
- Rename "RemotePlayAnything.exe" into the exact name of the binary of your donor game
  - In the case of ANYKEY you would rename "RemotePlayAnything.exe" into "ANYKEY.exe"
- Launch your donor game from Steam
- Done! RemotePlayAnything should start now

## How To Use
- Press the "Add Game" button, and select the binary of the game that should get the Steam overlay
- Then select your game in the list and press "Start Game"
- Now you can use the Steam overlay and therefore Remote Play Together in your game
